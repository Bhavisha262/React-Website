            <b><h4>Business Days + Holidays</h4></b>
            <p>Orders are processed Monday through Saturday, excluding major holidays.</p>
            <b><h4>Processing + Delivery Times</h4></b>
            <p>Once your order is placed, it generally takes us 1-3 business days to process and pack.  For orders to the 48 contiguous states, shipping generally takes 3-5 business days. Shipping can take longer -- roughly 6-8 business days -- if you are outside contiguous United States, i.e., Alaska and Hawaii or 12-14 business days if you are in Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands. If your order is shipping to a PO Box, it typically takes 6-8 business days for delivery. For APO, FPO and U.S Territories, please allow roughly 45 days for shipping. These shipping times are estimates only and cannot be guaranteed. Please see our Terms of Service for details. </p>
            <b><h4>Expedited Shipping Processing Times</h4></b>
            <p>If you select expedited or overnight shipping for your order, the order will typically ship out the same day if placed before 12:00PM PT, Monday - Friday. All orders placed after that time or on weekends, may be processed on the next business day. Note that orders place during high-order volume periods may experience a delay in overall processing times.  </p>
            <b><h4>Shipments to Forwarding Companies</h4></b>
            <p>Please note that if you choose to use a package forwarding company to ship your order outside of the United States, Grace Beauty will not be liable for any damage, defect, or loss that occurs. We will not be able to offer replacements or refunds for items that are reported missing or damaged if we have reason to believe that they have been delivered to a package forwarding company. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
